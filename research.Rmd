### [**Overview**:]{.underline}

My research primarily examines the reciprocal relationship between large animals (birds and mammals) and the chemistry of their environments, generally in the context of human ativities. However, I have a broad interest in ecology, wildlife, biogeochemistry, human-wildlife interactions, and conservation.

> ### **How do animals shape diverse ecosystems via nutrient dispersal and cycling?**
>
> The capacity for animals to store, recycle, and disperse nutrients within and between ecosystems is increasingly recognized; however, our ability to predict these roles at varying scales remains limited. My current research examines the contributions of birds and mammals to biogeochemical cycling and its consequences for ecosystem functioning, primarily in terrestrial systems.

> ### **How does nutritional limitation shape wildlife ecology?**
>
> Animals face many challenges for surival in the wild, including the acquisition of essential nutrients needed to grow, survive, and reproduce. My research examines the causes and consequences of nutrient deficiency in mammals and birds. I am particularly fascinated by how herbivorous animals adapt to sodium deficiency, and how such adaptations animal roles in ecosystem processes. I am also interested in how birds cope with high calcium requirements needed to lay eggs and grow remarkably fast in the wild. I combine field and modeling approaches to estimate animal nutrition, deficiency, and subsequent responses.

> ### **How are wildlife communities responding to diverse human impacts on ecosystems?**
>
> Humans have altered ecsosystems at every corner of our planet. Whether it be habitat, resource availability, climate, or direct removal of animal species, wildlife communities are most often forced to adapt. My research examines how animals respond spatially to human activities, mainly changes in resource availability (e.g., food subsidies, nutrients), as well as direct human disturbances (e.g., reduced habitat, hunting). I am particularly passionate about the impacts of oil development and indigenous hunting regimes in the Amazon, as well the impacts of hydropower and mining on freshwater wildlife communities.

> ### **How can humans and wildlife co-exist sustainably?**
>
> In order to understand status and trajectory of wildlife conservation, we must understand the human-dimension to wildlife challenges. An emerging area of interest in my researchh is working directly with people on the front lines of wildlife conservation challenges to understand their perspectives. I am particularly interested in learning how humans and wildlife can co-exist, and how we can leverage traditional and contemporary knowledge from local peoples to create positive ecological and social outcomes. I previously worked with farmers in the western United States, and now working with indigenous communities of the northwester Amazon Rainforest.
