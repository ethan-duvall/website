### [**Overview**:]{.underline}

My scientific research primarily examines the reciprocal relationship between large animals (such as birds and mammals) and the chemistry of their environments, generally in the context of human activities and pressures. However, I have a broad interest in ecology, wildlife, biogeochemistry, human-wildlife interactions, and conservation.

> ### **How do animal roles in biogeochemistry shape diverse ecosystems?**
>
> The capacity for animals to store, recycle, and disperse nutrients (such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sodium) within and between ecosystems is increasingly recognized as critical to biosphere functioning. However, predicting these roles at varying scales remains challenging. My current research aims to improve the way we quantify and understand animal contributions to biogeochemical cycling and its implications for terrestrial ecosystems.

## Wildlife nutrient deficiency and supplementation

> ### **How does nutritional limitation influence wildlife ecology and functions?**
>
> Animals face many challenges for survival in the wild, including the acquisition of essential nutrients needed to grow, survive, and reproduce. My research examines the causes and consequences of nutrient deficiency in mammals and birds. I am particularly fascinated by how herbivorous animals adapt to sodium deficiency, and how such adaptations influence animal roles in ecosystem processes. I am also interested in how birds cope with high calcium requirements needed to lay eggs and grow remarkably fast in the wild. I combine field and modeling approaches to estimate animal nutrition, deficiency, and subsequent responses.

## Animal responses to changing resource availability

> ### **How do wildlife communities cope with changing resources?** 
>
> Humans have altered ecosystems at every corner of our planet. Wildlife populations must now adapt to dynamic changes in the relative abundance, accessability, and quality of food resources. My research examines how animals respond to anthropogenic changes in resource availability (e.g., food, nutrients) and anthropogenic resource subsidies.

> ### **How can humans and wildlife co-exist sustainably?**
>
> In order to find solutions to biodiversity decline, we must find ways in which humans and wildlife can co-exist. I am increasingly interested in understanding social barriers to animal restoration (rewilding) and working directly with people on the front lines of wildlife conservation.
