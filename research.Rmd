### [Overview:]{.underline}

My research primarily examines (1) how anthropogenic activities impact wildlife communities, and (2) how wildlife communities influence ecosystem processes. Most of my research integrates ecology, wildlife science, biogeochemistry, and human-wildlife interactions, and is motivated by management, sustainability, and conservation challenges.

> ### **How do animals shape diverse ecosystems via nutrient dispersal and cycling?**
The capacity for animals to store, recycle, and disperse nutrients within and between ecosystems is increasingly recognized; however, our ability to predict these roles at varrying scales remains limited. My current research examines the contributions of birds and mammals roles, primarily in terrestrial systems, and how we can predict these roles for full communites at local and global scales. I utilize trait-based mechanistic modeling approaches, combining body and waste stoichiometry data, animal-trait datasets, field measurements, and local and global spatial datasets.

> ### **How does nutritional limitation shape wildlife ecology?** 
Animals face many challenges for surival in the wild, including the acquisition of essential nutrients needed to grow, survive, and reproduce. My research examines the causes and consequences of nutrient defficiency in mammals and birds. I am particularly fascinated by how herbivorous animals adapt to a scarcity of sodium, and how such adaptations animal roles in ecsosystem processes. I am also interested in how birds cope with high calcium requirements needed to lay eggs and grow remarkably fast in the wild. I combine field and modeling approaches to estimate animal nutrition, defficiency, and subsequent responses.

> ### **How are wildlife communities responding to diverse human impacts on ecosystems?** 
Humans have altered ecsosystems at every corner of our planet. Whether it be habitat, resource availability, climate, or direct removal of animal species, wildlife communities are most often forced to adapt. My research examines how animals respond spatially to human activities, mainly changes in resource availability (e.g., food subsidies, nutrients), as well as direct human disturbances (e.g., reduced habitat, hunting). I am particularly passionate about the impacts of oil development and indigenous hunting regimes in the Amazon, as well the impacts of hydropower and mining on freshwater wildlife communities.

> ###  **How can humans and wildlife co-exist sustainably?**
In order to understand status and trajectory of wildlife conservation, we must understand the human-dimension to wildlife challenges. An emerging area of interest in my reseach is working directly with people on the frontlines of wildlife conservation challenges to understand their perspectives. I am particularly interested in learning how humans and wildlife can co-exist, and how we can leverage traditional and contemporary knowledge from local peoples to create positive ecological and social outcomes. I previously worked with farmers in the western United States, and now working with indigenous communities of the northwester Amazon Rainforest.
