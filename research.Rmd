> ### Stoichiometry and Functioning
As highly mobile, abundant, and ubiquitous organisms, birds can have large impacts on ecosystem structure and function through their ability to recycle and redistribute important nutrients. The extent of these impacts depends on a birds abundance, movement patterns, stoichiometry of excreta, and the recipient ecosystem nutrient budgets. My current research aims to synthesize the vast literature focused on the roles that birds play as nutrient recycling agents including a meta-analysis of waste stoichiometry and a review of avian impacts on ecosystem structure and function. I hope to shed light on the important sustaining services that birds provide through their roles in biogeochemical cycling.

> ### Ecological stoichiometry and Na cycling by animals
Despite being one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, the Amazon Rainforest is a highly nutrient limiting environment. This is particularly true for Sodium (Na, which lacks major ecosystem inputs due to coastal salt deposition being blocked by the Andes, while also being subject to rapid leaching within the environment due to heavy precipitation and lack of retention within vegetation. This creates challenges for mammalian herbivores who are unable to ubtain sufficient Na within their natural diet. In order to counter these dietary defficiencies, animals seek out and ingest mineral rich soils at unique microhabitats called mineral licks. While the importance of Na as a limiting nutrient for all secondary consumers is clear, our understanding of the role that animals play in Na cycling remains poorly understood. My current research links Na physiology with animal-soil interactions to quanitfy the role of mammalian herbivores as nutrient vectors throughout the forest.

## **Calcium and birds: ecological interactions**

> ### **Calcium foraging behavior and preferences**
Birds lay eggs, and eggs-shells are made almost entirely out of calcium carbonate (CaCO3); yet the diet of nearly all non-carnivorous birds lacks sufficient calcium for egg-laying. Nestlings also need additional calcium for rapid skeletal growth during the breeding season. In order to meet these calcium requirments, birds must locate and consume calcium-rich material within their respective environments. My research aims to better understand the ecological interactions of birds and calcium in the wild, including how these interactions vary by species, calcium sources, season, and habitat. Our current research takes place in Ithaca, NY, using camera trapping techniques to record information on calcium foraging behaviour and preferences.

## **Riverbird responses to human impacts on rivers**

> ### **Riverbird responses to dam removal**
Dam removal has become a priority for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity globally. My research has focused on two of the largest dam removals in history on the Elwha River, WA, examining changes in the abundance and distribution of river-dependent birds before and after dam removal. Only 4 years after dam removal, species are returning to upstream river sections and nesting density of nearly all species has increased. Our work also suggests that riverbird responses can be effective indicators of restoration progress. I am now examining bird responses to the removal of smaller, more pervasive stream barriers in tributaries of the Hudson River, NY.

> ###  **Bald eagle responses to declining salmon carcasses**
Each winter, thousands of Bald Eagles from across western North America migrate to Pacific Northwest rivers to feed on the carcasses of post-spawning chum salmon. However, declining salmon populations and impacts of climate change are reducing the availability of salmon carcasses as a wintering food source for eagles. My research has focused on eagles ability to adjust to these impacts, specifically by redistributing to non-river habitats. My results suggest that the utilization of agricultural areas may be an important survival strategy for eagles as chum salmon carcasses continue to decline. Preliminary results of our follow-up study have shown that dairy farms are especially important, and that by feeding on dairy farm discards, eagles may actually provide services to farmers without conflict.
