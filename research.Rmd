## Response of Birds to Human Impacts on Rivers

I have examined how river-depenent birds are responding to dams on river
## Conservation Planning using GIS

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Habitat Preference Modeling with GIS to Elucidate Biodiversity Thresholds

Simple model selection techniques using Akaike information criterion (AIC) can be highly applicable for identifying habitat preferences and predicting species responses to changing habitat. Combined with GIS, we are able to link habitat preference measurements to landscape scale patterns to inform restoration outcomes, conservation priorities, or land management strategies.
