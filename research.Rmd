> ### **Stoichiometry and Functioning**
Birds are highly mobile, abundant, and metabolically active organisms, able to alter ecosystem structure and function through dispersion of nutrients they sequester and release. My current research examines drivers of variation in the body and waste stoichiometry (nutrient composition) of birds to underscore the mechanisms influencing how birds differentially mediate ecosystem processes. I hope to shed light on the importance of sustaining services that birds provide through their roles in biogeochemical cycling.

> ### **Animals, mineral licks, and Na cycling**
Despite its exceptional biodiversity, the rainforests of western Amazonia are in short supply of many important nutrients. This is particularly true for sodium (Na), which lacks major ecosystem inputs and selective retention by plants. Consequently, plant consumers (herbivores) face challenges in obtaining sufficient Na within their natural diet. While Na shortfall has been shown to limit production of smaller organisms (such as termites) and their impact on ecosystems (such as decomposition), large herbivores are able to seek areas called mineral licks to ingest Na-rich soil and water. While the importance of Na on ecosystem functioning is more clear, the role that animals play in Na cycling remains poorly understood. Quantifying animal-roles in biogeochemical cycling is essential to understanding anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem functioning through changes in the environment (e.g., oil extraction in western Amazonia) or animal populations themselves (e.g., game hunting). My research examines these roles through spatially-explicit model simulations, biotic and abiotic field measurements, and study of anthropogenic disturbances in the western Amazon.

## **Ca selection by birds **
<details>

> ### **Foraging behavior and preferences**
Birds lay eggs, and eggs-shells are made almost entirely out of calcium carbonate (CaCO3); yet the diet of many non-carnivorous birds lacks sufficient calcium for egg-laying. Nestlings also need additional calcium for rapid skeletal growth during the breeding season. In order to meet these calcium requirments, birds must locate and consume calcium-rich material within their respective environments. My goal is to better understand the ecological interactions of birds and calcium in the wild, including how these interactions vary by species, calcium sources, season, and habitat. The research currently takes place in Ithaca, NY, using camera trapping techniques to record information on calcium foraging behaviour and preferences.

> ### **Riverbird responses to dam removal**
Dam removal has become a priority for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity globally. My research has focused on two of the largest dam removals in history on the Elwha River, WA, examining changes in the abundance and distribution of river-dependent birds before and after dam removal. Only 4 years after dam removal, species are returning to upstream river sections and nesting density of nearly all species has increased. Our work also suggests that riverbird responses can be effective indicators of restoration progress. I am now examining bird responses to the removal of smaller, more pervasive stream barriers in tributaries of the Hudson River, NY.

> ###  **Bald eagle responses to declining salmon carcasses**
Each winter, thousands of Bald Eagles from across western North America migrate to Pacific Northwest rivers to feed on the carcasses of post-spawning chum salmon. However, declining salmon populations and impacts of climate change are reducing the availability of salmon carcasses as a wintering food source for eagles. My research has focused on eagles ability to adjust to these impacts, specifically by redistributing to non-river habitats. My results suggest that the utilization of agricultural areas may be an important survival strategy for eagles as chum salmon carcasses continue to decline. Preliminary results of our follow-up study have shown that dairy farms are especially important, and that by feeding on dairy farm discards, eagles may actually provide services to farmers without conflict.
