I am an ecologist with particular interests in wildlife and biogeochemistry. Most of my research examines wildlife responses to human activities and how this affects ecosystems - bridging gaps between animal science (ecology, nutrition, physiology, movement, and behavior), elemental cycling, and ecosystem functioning. I am largely motivated by issues of conservation and sustainability and strive to conduct research that improves the way we understand and protect biodiversity.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Cornell University advised by [Dr. Alex Flecker](https://fleckerlab.weebly.com/){target="_blank"} working between New York and western Amazonia. I received my BS in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Terrestrial Ecology from Western Washington University. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS Lead for Cascade Water Alliance, a municipal water supply corporation in the Puget Sound region. I have worked various outdoor jobs in the past, and am passionate about being in the field. I grew up in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State and will always call the Pacific Northwest home.
