I am an ecologist with particular interests in wildlife and biogeochemistry. Most of my research examines wildlife responses to human activities and its broader consequences for ecosystems - bridging gaps between animal science (ecology, nutrition, physiology, movement, and behavior) and ecosystem functioning. I am largely motivated by issues of conservation and sustainability and strive to conduct research that improves the way we understand and protect biodiversity.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Cornell University advised by [Dr. Alex Flecker](https://fleckerlab.weebly.com/){target="_blank"}. I am also the President of the [Amazon Research & Conservation Collaborative (ARCC)](https://www.rainforest-arcc.org/){target="_blank"}, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on conserving the Ecuadorian Amazon. I received my BS in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Terrestrial Ecology from Western Washington University, advised by [Dr. John McLaughlin](https://faculty.jmcl.wwu.edu/). Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS Program Lead for [Cascade Water Alliance](https://cascadewater.org/), a municipal water corporation in the Puget Sound region. I have worked various outdoor jobs in the past (e.g., guide, technician), and am passionate about being in the field. I grew up in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington State and will always call the Pacific Northwest home.
