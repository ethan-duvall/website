I am an ornithologist with broad interests in spatial ecology, freshwater ecology, and ecological stoichiometry. In general, my research focuses on bird responses to anthropogenic change and addresses the implications of these responses. I strive to conduct use-based research that will improve our understanding of biodiversity while promoting its conservation. I look to integrate the use of geospatial tools such as GIS, remote sensing, and spatial statistics to uncover ways of maximizing biodiversity in our increasingly crowded world.

I am currently a PhD student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Cornell University. I received my BS in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Terrestrial Ecology from Western Washington University. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS Lead for Cascade Water Alliance, a municipal water supply corporation in the Puget Sound reguion. I have worked a variety of field jobs in the past, from outdoor guiding to tracking mountain goats in the North Cascades. I grew up at the base of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State and will always call the Pacific Northwest home.
