I am an ornithologist with interests in spatial ecology, freshwater ecology, and ecological stoichiometry. In general, my research focuses on bird responses to anthropogenic change and addresses the implications of these responses. I am largely motivated by issues of conservation and sustainability, and strive to conduct basic and applied research that improves the way we understand and protect biodiversity.

I am currently a PhD student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Cornell University. I received my BS in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Terrestrial Ecology from Western Washington University. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS Lead for Cascade Water Alliance, a municipal water supply corporation in the Puget Sound region. I have worked various outdoor jobs in the past, and find much of my inspiration out in the field. I grew up at the base of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State and will always call the Pacific Northwest home.
