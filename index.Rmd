I am an ornithologist with broad interests in spatial ecology, freshwater ecology, ecological stoichiometry, and conservation of biodiversity. In general, my research focuses on bird responses to anthropogenic change and addresses the implications of these responses. I strive to conduct basic and applied research that improves the way we understand and conserve biodiversity.

I am currently a PhD student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Cornell University. I received my BS in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Terrestrial Ecology from Western Washington University. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS Lead for Cascade Water Alliance, a municipal water supply corporation in the Puget Sound region. I have worked various outdoor jobs in the past, and find much of my inspiration out in the field. I grew up in North Bend, WA and will always call the Pacific Northwest home.
